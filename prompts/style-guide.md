## Style Guide — Wording

### Voice & Tone
- Friendly, concise, confident. Avoid filler and jargon.
- Prefer active voice; address the user directly.

### Labels & Buttons
- Start with verbs (e.g., "Save", "Apply filters").
- Use Title Case for buttons; Sentence case for body text.

### Clarity & Brevity
- Prefer short sentences; one idea per line.
- Avoid ambiguous terms ("stuff", "things", "it").

### Consistency
- Preferred terms: "Sign in", not "Log in"; "Email", not "E-mail".
- Use American English by default.

### Accessibility
- Ensure labels are understandable without surrounding context.
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely known.


### Component & Slot Naming (for parity with design/code)
- Use consistent slot names in copy and annotations: `header`, `media`, `body`, `footer`, `actions`.
- Prefer camelCase in developer-facing references; match Figma slot names.
- When referencing actions in copy, be explicit (e.g., “Primary action” vs “Action”).
